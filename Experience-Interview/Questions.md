##### Why are you interested in Facebook? & Examples
1. Most importantly I want to move quick, learn as much as I can and create things w/ an impact, right now I feel like i'm playing catchup with tools and technologies when I want to leading it. It seems like FB has this exact community.
2. The collab, I want to work alongside people who will push themselves and learn from each other. A group always striving to be the best.
3. Openness, FB constantly talks about how all parts of the company should be open to all employees. If I want to learn about the VR product than I should be able to read their APIs. Right now I can't even configure my own deploy plan.
4. The leadership, Sheryl Sandberg seems amazing. Heard her talk a few times and learned about Zuckerburgs Q/A. I'd be happy to go in the direction they want, and if I don't I can likely voice my opinion.
